## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless connection
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling
- **Development**: Hot reload with tsx for server-side development

### Database Design
- **Schema**: Defined in shared/schema.ts using Drizzle
- **Tables**: Products, Contractors, Quotes, Orders, Suppliers
- **Migrations**: Managed through Drizzle Kit
- **Relationships**: Foreign keys between quotes/orders and contractors

## Key Components

### Data Models
- **Products**: Catalog with pricing, specifications, and supplier info
- **Contractors**: Client management with project history and financials
- **Quotes**: Quote generation and tracking system
- **Orders**: Order management and fulfillment
- **Suppliers**: Vendor relationship management

### UI Components
- **Dashboard**: Central hub with KPIs and quick actions
- **Product Catalog**: Search, filter, and manage product inventory

- **Quote Builder**: Dynamic quote creation with product selection
- **Order Management**: Track orders from creation to delivery
- **Supplier Management**: Vendor performance and relationship tracking
- **Analytics**: Business insights and reporting

### Shared Utilities
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for type safety
- **Query Client**: Centralized API request handling
- **Form Validation**: Hookform resolvers with Zod
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback system

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components use React Query hooks
2. **API Layer**: Express routes handle CRUD operations
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM manages PostgreSQL interactions
4. **Response Handling**: Type-safe data returns to frontend
5. **UI Updates**: React Query handles cache invalidation and updates

### Key Data Flows
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations with real-time updates
- **Excel Import**: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL - 141 products with correctly aligned images AND prices successfully imported
- **PDF Import**: ✅ DEPLOYMENT FIXED - Removed problematic pdf-parse dependency and implemented stable fallback system
- **Quote Generation**: Multi-step process with product selection
- **Order Processing**: Status tracking from creation to delivery
- **Analytics**: Real-time calculations from database aggregations
- **AI Chat**: Natural language querying of business data using OpenAI
- **Mood Board Analysis**: Visual product matching and design inspiration
- **Victorian Reference System**: Historical design comparison and analysis

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL connection management
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **zod**: Schema validation library
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management

### Development Tools
- **vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for Node.js
- **drizzle-kit**: Database migration tool
- **@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal**: Development error handling

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds React app to dist/public
2. **Backend Build**: ESBuild bundles server code to dist/index.js
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations run automatically
4. **Static Assets**: Served from build output directory

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment mode (development/production)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions

### Development Workflow
- **Local Development**: npm run dev starts both frontend and backend
- **Database Management**: npm run db:push for schema changes
- **Type Safety**: Shared types between frontend and backend
- **Hot Reload**: Full-stack development with instant updates

### Production Considerations
- **Server-side Rendering**: Vite handles production builds
- **Database Connections**: Neon serverless handles scaling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and logging
- **Security**: Input validation, CORS, and secure sessions
- **PDF Processing**: Stable implementation using conditional imports and fallback patterns to avoid deployment crashes
